## Why there is no default command to update all NPM packages

You might think you will be spared from breaking changes if you are only using flashy new JS stuff. 
The truth is, everything changes over time, even the flashy stuff. A quick google 
for "upgrade all node packages" landed me on [this article](https://medium.com/@jh3y/how-to-update-all-npm-packages-in-your-project-at-once-17a8981860ea).

The article even warned me explicitly of the dangers of doing this.

> New major versions may introduce breaking changes that could break your project. 
> You want to avoid this scenario. The restricted power of npm update promotes manual updates.
> In turn, manual updates make it easier to spot the culprit if something should break

## The lesson

Just update packages manually, you will save time in the long run.
