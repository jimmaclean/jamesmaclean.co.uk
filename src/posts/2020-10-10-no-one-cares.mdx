## Define 'cares'

What I mean when I say no one cares, is that it's not valued in the tech industry. 
Despite increasing focus on Design and UX in the industry, no one is willing to pay top dollar for a CSS expert.
Maybe because CSS it's easy start, or that you can be bad and still get things done.

## Why do it then?

Only peruse CSS if you like it, don't think you will be financially rewarded for knowing it deeply.
If you are a designer or a developer it makes a great secondary skill, but don't make the mistake I did and put a decade of effort into the topic.
