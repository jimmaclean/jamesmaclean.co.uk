<h1>Margin indicator</h1>

<p>Once the trader has locked in a price to quote to the client, the underlying market can still move. This movement can even result in more profit, but also can make the trade unprofitable. Depending on the banks policy and the seniority of the trader they can use their discretion to execute unprofitable trades for the sake of the relationship with the client.</p>
<p>The indicator gives a real time visual representation of the difference between the locked and market prices.</p>

<p>The first version of the indicator had a large bar. Feedback from traders told me that the size of the indicator was overkill.</p>
<h3>Key user needs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>'Am I still safe' i.e. green is good</li>
</ul>
<p>This need can be easily served with a smaller bar which gives room for more useful features for re-setting the margin and also makes the actual data more legible.</p>

<p>Once all the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features were developed the initial layout of the product was starting to show its inadequacy.</p>
