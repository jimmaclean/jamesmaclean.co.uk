    <h3>Animation styleguide</h3>
    <p>I have created a set of guidelines for all digital design and development to follow across all areas of the business globally.</p>

    <h2>FundsNetwork</h3>

    <p>FundsNetwork is administration software for financial advisory firms to manage their clients investment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I delivered key features under tight deadlines and technical constraints as part of the ongoing mantanence of the product.</li>
        <li>I worked on a reporting feature which conveys complex financial reporting in a clear way that the end clients can understand easily.</li>
        <li>I worked on a strategic re-design of some key areas of the product which has required me to undertake a thorough understanding of the entire financial advice process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Client reporting</h3>
    <p>Reporting to clients is a fundamental part of an advisory business. They are often generatedÂ manually to varying degrees of quality. This document is the result of several rounds of user testing to measure the comprehension of the financial scenario it reports on.</p>
