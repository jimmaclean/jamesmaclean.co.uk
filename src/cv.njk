<h1>James Maclean</h1>

<h3>The type of work I do</h3>
<p>
  I like to collaborate with design, product and backend people to develop user
  focused front end work.
</p>

<p>
  Today I work with React.js, Next.js, Redux at a seinor level. I’m an expert
  with CSS and HTML and can achieve pixel perfect results with performant
  animations. Having a background in design means I am sensitive to the details
  of design/UX and can act as an extra design resource when needed.
</p>
<p>I’m happy to mentor and coach junior developers and UX designers.</p>

<h3 class="m-t-8">What I’m looking for</h3>
<h4>Remote work</h4>
<p>
  I’m looking for 80-99% remote work. (Max. 1 day per week in London). I’m Also
  interested in 4 day weeks and 9 day fortnights.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately I am looking for a position where I can continue to care for my
  children and parents around Milton Keynes.
</p>

<h4 class="m-t-6">The type of work environment I enjoy</h4>
<p>
  Clear goals and the autonomy to pursue them with friendly people who are
  excited to get stuff done. I also believe that good written communication is
  necessary for effective remote work so much as I love to ‘jump on a call’ I
  also want people to put the effort into writing things down to facilitate
  async communication.
</p>

<h4 class="m-t-6">Technologies</h4>
<p>
  Technologies that are especialy interesting to me: Svelt.js, Vue.js, HTMX,
  Symfony(PHP) + Turbo, Golang + HTML templates.
</p>

<h3 class="m-t-8">How long have I been wiring code?</h3>
<p>
  I’m self taught, it took me a long time to get anywhere because I was mostly
  focused on design until 2018. But because I had spend so long doing it ‘on the
  side’ my first developer job was at mid-level and I quickly progressed to
  senior.
</p>

<p>
  I started my career in print design just after the global financial crisis.
  After a year or so I realised my path didn’t have the brightest of futures. I
  had been building and debugging my own gaming PCs since I was 12 so I thought
  I should lean towards that passion a little.
</p>

{#
<p>
  The approach I took to delivering the print work was to ‘program’ the styles
  in Adobe InDesign. I would spend most the time setting up templates and styles
  that would (almost) automatically lay the document out when the content
  arrived on my desk. There is a lot in common to what I did back then to modern
  ‘design systems’.
</p>
#}

<p>
  In 2009 I used dreamweaver to create an HTML interface for a CD-ROM filled
  with pdf documents. Around 2012 I started to write production ready CSS and
  used jQuery to make clickable prototypes with my photoshop designs. By 2016 I
  was helping out the development team by working on the Backbone.js project no
  one had time for.
</p>

<p>
  In 2019 I used a redundancy as the drive to 'go pro' and spend a month sudying
  then got my first propper developer job.
</p>

<h3 class="m-t-8">My mantras</h3>

<h4 class="m-t-8">Things I struggle with:</h4>
<p>Details.</p>
<p>
  I am dyslexic, this means I am bad at spotting small details but very good at
  seeing the bigger picture and extrapolating form incomplete data. I won’t spot
  a typo but I will be able to tell when a problem you face is similar to
  something another team are working on. I won’t see the arithmetic error but I
  enjoy discussing macro-economics.
